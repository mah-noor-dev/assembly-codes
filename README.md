⚙️ Assembly Language Programs – 8086 MASM
📌 Overview
This repository contains a curated set of Assembly language programs, primarily written for the 8086 microprocessor architecture using the MASM (Microsoft Macro Assembler) syntax. These codes are designed to demonstrate core low-level concepts such as register manipulation, memory addressing, arithmetic and logical operations, control flow, and string handling.

Assembly language forms the backbone of system-level programming and gives direct insight into how computers process instructions at the hardware level. This repository is ideal for students studying Computer Architecture, Microprocessors, or Embedded Systems, as well as enthusiasts interested in understanding how software interacts with hardware.

🔧 What’s Inside
The repository includes well-documented examples across a variety of core topics:

🔹 Basic I/O using INT 21h

🔹 Register-level arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)

🔹 Control flow using loops, jumps, and conditional instructions

🔹 Binary and Hexadecimal conversions

🔹 String handling using SI, DI, LODS, STOS, MOVSB, etc.

🔹 Logical operations: AND, OR, XOR, NOT, shifting and masking

🔹 Memory addressing and segment-offset manipulation

🔹 Subroutines and modular code using CALL and RET

Each program is structured to be minimal yet demonstrative of key concepts, with inline comments and segment-level separation (.DATA, .CODE, .STACK).

🧠 Learning Objectives
Through this repository, learners will:
